# A Tiny Little Compliance Stack (ATLCS)

This repo contains the API, Github workflows, and assets used internally to help facilitate Nabla's compliance-as-code vision without heavy opinionation and allowing clients and users to use their own tools, with the caveat that at the moment they are up for using Github Actions for the main automations. 

## Features

- Lightweight Compliance API – Programmatically interact with compliance controls and frameworks.

- GitHub Actions Workflows – Pre-built workflows to automate compliance tasks and audits.

- Extensible Assets – All controls can be extended and developed iterively and as fast or slow as we need to. 

- Framework-Agnostic – Supports multiple standards and tool stacks (e.g., FedRAMP, Airtable, CMMC) without locking users into a particular toolchain.

- Audit-Friendly – Outputs and logs are structured for easy review and reporting.
